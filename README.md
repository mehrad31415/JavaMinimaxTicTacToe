# JavaMinimaxTicTacToe

### This is an interactive Tic tac toe game written in java. 

##### There are four classes Display, GamePrinciples, Main, and Minimax.
Class Display pretty prints the board for display. The GamePrinciples class takes into account the rules for the game to end/continue.
Class Main contains the main game loop and the interaction section. The Minimax class implements the minimax algorithm in a recursive manner.
